# Web Design Agency Showcase

This project is a simple website layout created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to showcase a web design agency's services and portfolio. The website includes sections for featured projects and highlights the agency's expertise in UX research, design, and audits.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the website.
- **CSS**: Adds styling and layout to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic elements, enhancing user experience.

## Features
- **Portfolio Section**: Highlights completed projects like Accern, Rhea, and AfroTech, complete with images and videos.
- **Service Section**: Outlines core services such as UX Research, UX Design, UI Design, and UX Audits.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website is fully responsive, adjusting for different screen sizes and devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Uses JavaScript to enhance the website’s interactivity, such as media controls or dynamic content.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two key sections:

1. **Project Portfolio**
   - Displays featured projects with an image and video for each.
   - Includes brief descriptions of the projects and the design process behind them.

2. **Service Offerings**
   - Lists core services provided by the agency: UX Research, UX Design, UI Design, and UX Audits.
   - Each service is explained briefly to give users insight into the agency's offerings.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3. Replace the image and video links in the HTML file with your own media if needed.
4. Customize the text to reflect your agency’s branding or offerings.
5. Modify the CSS and JS files if further customization or interactivity is required.

## How It Works

1. **HTML**: The HTML file provides the structure of the webpage, including different sections like the portfolio and service descriptions.
2. **CSS**: The `styles.css` file contains styles to make the website responsive, ensuring it looks good on various devices (e.g., desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
3. **JavaScript**: The `script.js` file handles any interactivity such as media controls (for videos), animations, or dynamic content loading.
